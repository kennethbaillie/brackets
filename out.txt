shared_tasklist.qmd > EMMC shared notes > Overview and policies > Admin and preparation

- [ ] make draft schedule for postdocs in delivery phase to show that it is possible [Lizi, Max]

 >  >  > Computational preparation

- [ ] collate favourite genes [Everyone]

- [ ] define list of "GWAS genes" to use for evaluating pilot data, with an arbitrary maximum number of "GWAS genes" arising from any one phenotype [Konrad, Kenny]. Use proximity (eg FANTOM5 TSS =/- 10000bp) to GWAS hits at a given p-value threshold, with a maximum (n) hits from a given study, and a separate maximum (m) hits from a given phenotype in the GWAS catalog. 

- [ ] define "GWAS hits explained" in hard methods terms [Konrad, Andy]

 >  >  > Core data and metrics

- [ ] write script to download, clean and summarise GWAS hits from GWAS catalog and any other sources. Output should be complete list of robust associations with: (a) any human disease (b) any disease-related trait. We will call these our **"GWAS hit set"**.

- [ ] write script to use the **GWAS hit set** set to define the set of "Disease transcripts"

- [ ] write and test methodology for identifying **"GWAS hits explained"** : i.e. number of GWAS hits in the **GWAS hit set** that significantly co-localise with an eQTL in eQTLgen, GTEx, or EMMC datasets. 

- [ ] create systematic wish list of tissues for EMMC. Delegate. Joint synovium, bone, cartilage, bone marrow, uterine tissue, fallopian tube, vas deferens, spleen, liver, gut. What healthy tissues are available; what GWAS data exist? [Johnny]

 >  > Pilot Pilot phase

- [ ] choose brain regions [Paul]

- [ ] coordinate with tissue-specific ECRs/PIs for SOPs

- [ ] date and plan

 >  >  > First plate setup (pilot-pilot):

- [ ] confirm SOPs 

- [ ] price up reagents

- [ ] date and plan

- [ ] Confirm sequencing

 >  > EMMC Admin Meetings (latest 10 June 2024)

- [ ] Look for additional perturbations (not limited to 4 core tissues). [Max, Lizi]

- [ ] Look for published RNA-Seq (bulk or single cell) data for Alzheimer's to identify similarites, differences between samples for potential perturbation stocks. [Max, Lizi]

- [ ] Develop efficient nuclei extraction SOPs for each tissue. [Max, Lizi]

- [ ] Prep for next EMMC progress meeting (08.07.2024 TBC) [Max, Lizi, Primmy]

    - [ ] Check vibratome and components are usable [Lizi, Max]

 >  > Nuclei extraction optimization and tissue work > (2) PCLS: Nuclei extraction from piglet and adult Porcine PCLS.

- [ ] Fresh PCLS

    - [ ] Live-dead stain flow cytometry of pre-lysed cells (fresh vs frozen PCLS - death toll of freezing PCLS?).

 >  > Meeting Sara B - 13-June-2024

- [ ] Sara B to talk to Rebecca Reynolds about access for re-excision c-section skin tissue [Sara B].

- [ ] Check costing of courier from Glasgow to Edinburgh [Primmy].

 >  > Pilot Pilot phase

- [x] Quantify expected median time to first analysis for fresh skin from Edinburgh and Glasgow, with evidence for each. Use existing experience in Sara Brown lab for to work out median time for Edinburgh. The endpoint should be the point of freezing an unperturbed sample for nuclear extraction. [Max]
